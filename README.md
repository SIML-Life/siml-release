# üöÄ Quick Start (Visualization Required)

## Step 1: Install [Godot 4.4.1](https://godotengine.org/download)

Make sure it's the **same version** used to export the `.pck` (e.g., Godot 4.4.1+).

## Step 2: Run the Visualizer

From terminal or PowerShell:

#### Linux
```bash
./Godot --main-pack godot_visualizer.pck
```
#### Windows
```
Godot.exe --main-pack godot_visualizer.pck
```
#### macOS
```
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --main-pack godot_visualizer.pck
```
You can also drag & drop `godot_visualizer.pck` onto the Godot executable.

## Step 3: Run the SIML Agent

### üß† SIML Command Line Usage

Once you've downloaded the correct `siml` binary for your platform, you can run the simulation via:

```bash
./siml-[platform] [OPTIONS]
```

### Available Flags

| Flag               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--record-mode`    | Output mode for recording simulation (`bit` or `rgb`). Default: `bit`.     |
| `--runs`           | Number of worms to simulate sequentially. Default: `1`.                    |
| `--use-memory`     | Load memory from previous agent run and persist schema learning.           |            |

#### Example: Run 10 worms with memory

```bash
./siml-[platform] --runs 10 --use-memory
```

The simulator will save a `.bin` file to record your runs, and start over with the saved `.bin` every time. If you want to start from scratch again, simply rename or remove the `.bin`. 

For platform specific binaries, in a second terminal window:

#### Linux
```bash
./siml-linux-x64
```
#### Windows
```
.\siml-windows-x64.exe
```
#### macOS
```
chmod +x siml-apple-silicon
./siml-apple-silicon
```

### Logs
You‚Äôll see logs like:
```
[SIML] Starting Capsule‚Ä¶
[SIML] Run 0 spawned at (x, y, z)
...

```
